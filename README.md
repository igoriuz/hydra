# Hydra
Build responsive widgets with ease. Define up to four different looks for the same widget. Every hydra can have different breakpoints which determines when an alternative should appear.

## Motivation
Achieving responsiveness can be a tedious task because of multiple factors like orientation, screen width and so on. Without a clear definition it's difficult to scale apps which heavily rely on responsiveness.

## What does Hydra do?
- Decides which widget it should show depending on your breakpoints
- Automatically show the next matching widget, if there's no suitable alternative for the current breakpoint
- Apply your ruleset (=behaviour) about switching widgets

## What doesn't Hydra do?
- Any "magical" scaling in the background (like font sizes)
- Calculating different sizes/ constraints for your widget
